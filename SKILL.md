# Nintendo DS Game Development

This skill is the complete DS development workflow. Use its bundled scripts,
runtime, container image, templates, scenarios, and validators; do not ask the
user to know DS toolchain commands.

## Supported host and setup

- Supported host: Windows 10/11, PowerShell, plus Docker Desktop (normally with
  WSL2 integration) or Docker Engine and WSL2 installed separately. Docker is
  the BlocksDS container backend; WSL2 runs the bundled DeSmuME/GDB runtime.
- Run `scripts/setup.ps1` to automatically bootstrap the environment. It checks
  prerequisites, downloads the headless DeSmuME runtime from GitHub Releases if
  not present, and prepares the BlocksDS container image.
- Run `scripts/check-toolchain.ps1` to verify whether Docker, WSL2, Python,
  the BlocksDS image, and the DeSmuME runtime are ready.
- If the offline BlocksDS image tar is available in `images/`, `scripts/load-blocksds-image.ps1`
  loads it; otherwise it pulls `skylyrac/blocksds:slim-latest` from Docker Hub.
- If Docker/WSL2 is missing, explain the host requirement and stop before making
  system changes.

## Project contract and onboarding

For an existing project, inspect `AGENTS.md`, `DESIGN.md`, `TECHNICAL.md`,
`STATUS.md`, `README.md`, and `.ds-game-dev/project.json` when present.

The standard project layout is:

```text
source/ include/ tests/ scenarios/ tools/ artifacts/
AGENTS.md DESIGN.md TECHNICAL.md STATUS.md README.md
.ds-game-dev/project.json
```

If the project is new or this contract is incomplete, ask whether the user
wants onboarding before creating or changing files. With approval, run
`scripts/scaffold-project.ps1` and ask the product questions needed to draft
`AGENTS.md` and `DESIGN.md`; show those drafts and wait for approval before
writing them.

## Autonomous development loop

For a feature, improvement, bug fix, or UI change, complete the available
build, host tests, scenario, capture, log, and diagnosis loop autonomously.
Do not ask the user to perform a step that the skill can perform. Stop only
when the remaining evidence needs human listening, physical hardware, or a
product decision.

1. Identify the user-visible or technical hypothesis.
2. Read the project contract and relevant source/tests.
3. Run the smallest relevant host test and add or update a project test when
   the changed logic needs one.
4. Build the current ROM with `scripts/build-project.ps1`.
5. Run a project-owned scenario with `scripts/run-scenario.ps1` when the
   behavior is observable.
6. Read `manifest.json`, `events.jsonl`, `emulator.log`, and relevant PNGs.
7. For UI changes, perform the UX evidence loop below and iterate on defects.
8. Update `STATUS.md` only with facts supported by the evidence.
9. Report facts, inferences, proposals, and physical validation boundaries
   separately.

## Build and host tests

Use `scripts/build-project.ps1 -ProjectPath <repo>`. It reads the project's
`.ds-game-dev/project.json`, loads the bundled BlocksDS image, copies the
declared source/assets into an isolated build tree, runs `make`, and writes the
requested ROM output.

Run the host test commands declared in `project.json` with
`scripts/run-host-tests.ps1` before and after the change. A build passing is
not a behavioral test.

## DeSmuME scenarios and evidence

Use `scripts/run-scenario.ps1` with the current ROM, a project-owned scenario,
and an output directory under `artifacts/`. Scenarios support `tap`, explicit
`release`, `button_down`, `button_up`, `drag`, frame counts, captures, event
traces, state assertions, and targeted visual assertions.

For every observable behavior, require a host-side contract test and a real
input scenario that performs the modified gesture. Read the manifest first,
then events, logs, and relevant captures. A `PASS`, `screen_changed`, pixel
difference, or screenshot hash alone never proves the hypothesis.

### UX evidence loop

For every UI change:

1. Capture the relevant initial state.
2. Execute the real modified gesture.
3. Capture the resulting state and any needed menu, boundary, scroll, or
   edited-surface states.
4. Review layout, clipping, overlap, labels, legibility, hitboxes, feedback,
   focus, and interaction clarity against the project's `DESIGN.md`.
5. If a defect is found, fix it and repeat the scenario and review.

Do not declare the loop complete while a known visual defect remains. Explain
what each capture proves. Use a close-up when the affected surface is too small
to judge at native resolution.

## GDB and runtime diagnostics

Use `scripts/validate-gdb.ps1 -RomPath <rom>` only for a concrete diagnostic hypothesis. The
runtime exposes ARM9 GDB remote debugging; it does not prove source-level
symbols, audio, physical timing, or hardware compatibility.

## DS upload

Build and validation do not upload automatically. Upload only after explicit
user confirmation immediately before the external mutation. Use
`scripts/upload-rom.ps1 -ProjectPath <repo> -RomPath <rom> -ConfirmUpload`.

The skill provides default FTP settings without a password. Project-local
overrides may be supplied through an ignored config file. On connection or
verification failure, do not retry blindly: report the exact failure and ask
the user to validate the IP, port, path, and device availability.

After upload, report the ROM path, commit/build identity, remote target, and
that audio and physical behavior still require listening on the DS.

## Boundaries

- Product meaning, visual language, controls, and UX acceptance criteria come
  from the project's `DESIGN.md`.
- Implementation invariants come from `TECHNICAL.md`.
- Worktrees, branches, commits, merge permission, and repository ownership come
  from the project's `AGENTS.md`.
- Do not use Android, ADB, melonDS, or NO$GBA unless the project explicitly
  authorizes a distinct diagnostic workflow.
- Do not claim physical audio or DS/DSi compatibility from emulation.
